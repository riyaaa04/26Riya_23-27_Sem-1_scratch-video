Animated Physics Simulation

Create an animated physics simulation in Scratch. Your project should include:

A physics-related scenario (e.g., a bouncing ball, pendulum, or simple physics experiment).
Visual elements representing the physical objects.
User interaction to control or adjust parameters of the simulation.
Realistic physics behavior and feedback.
